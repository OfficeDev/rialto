                What is the deal with the "chat crawl"?
            </p>
            <p class='content'>
                We encourage group discussion of the content being presented, to spark new ideas and help the group as a whole get smarter and better-connected.
                In the conference room, chat activity on our channel is displayed on screens to either side of the main stage.<br><br>
                You can go to our Teams channel to participate in the discussion.<br><br>
                The system is intended to be a fun way for the audience to participate that (hopefully) does not excessively distract the room's attention
                and remains respectful of the current speaker on stage.
            </p>

            <p class='heading'>
                How does it do that?
            </p>
            <p class='content'>
                It shows a "curated" view of the live chat stream instead of a raw feed:
            </p>
            <ul class='content'>
                <li>Only top-level posts are shown (not full reply threads).</li>
                <li>Posts that ask a question are shown above other posts.</li>
                <li>Posts are ranked by "engagement", currently measured by the number of unique people replying.</li>
                <li>Replies in comment threads can be marked as an "answer", causing it to show up on the live stream.</li>
                <li>Text-only (no GIFs).</li>
            </ul>
            <p class='content'>
                This works via a Teams bot that listens to all channel activity. It can also accept <b>commands</b> added to the end of replies:
            </p>
            <ul class='content'>
                <li><img src='images/check.png' width='20px' style='vertical-align:-3px'>&nbsp;Mark your reply as the answer the original post with <b>/answer</b></li>
                <li><img src='images/pin.png' width='20px' style='vertical-align:-3px'>&nbsp;Pin post to the top with <b>/pin</b> (undo with <b>/unpin</b>)</li>
                <li>Hide post with <b>/hide</b> (undo with <b>/unhide</b>)</li>
            </ul>
            <p class='content'>
                Last writer wins. Be civil :)
            </p>

            <p class='heading'>
                Can I just "like" a post to increase its engagement score?
            </p>
            <p class='content'>
                Unfortunately, due to technical limitations, the Rialto bot won't get notifications of likes. You "upvote" a post by adding a reply, which could just be "+1". Only the number of unique people replying, not the total number of replies, determines the engagement score for ranking.
            </p>

            <p class='heading'>
                Can I edit a post after it's appeared on the big screen?
            </p>
            <p class='content'>
                Similar to "likes", Teams does not send edit notifications to bots, so it will not know about your edit. You can use the <b>/hide</b> command in a reply to remove any post from the screen if necessary.
                Or use <b>/answer</b> to add a clarification.
            </p>

            <p class='heading'>
                What does adding a #hashtag to a post do?
            </p>
            <p class='content'>
                Each presentation has its own hashtag. If you want to associate your post with a presentation <i>that is not currently happening live on stage</i>, add its hashtag.
                There is no need to add a hashtag if your post is about the current presentation, it will be associated automatically.<br><br>
                You can use the #offtopic hashtag for comments not associated with anything on the agenda.<br><br>
                Each presentation has a permalink (keyed via its hashtag) that allows you to pull up the comments for that talk (i.e. reconstruct the live view that was in the room at the time).<br><br>
                All hashtags are listed in the agenda. Note: if you add multiple hashtags, your post will only be associated with the first one (see exception about #TellMeMore below).
            </p>

            <p class='heading'>
                What is special about the #TellMeMore hashtag?
            </p>
            <p class='content'>
                Near the end of the conference, we will have a panel discussion that we'll organize "just in time" based on what we think the audience would be interested in learning more about,
                and we'll bring a few speakers from earlier in the conference back up on stage.<br><br>
                To help inform whom we select, you can tag any post (including replies) with the special #TellMeMore hashtag (lowercase is fine too).
                This hashtag can be combined with regular speaker hashtags and the right thing will happen.
